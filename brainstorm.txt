// Implement Auth Feature
   - fixed app start even with DB connection error with process.exit(1);

// Data extraction
- I researched about MegaParse, DocLing and LlamaParse turns out they only have Python SDK
- I am going to rely on Langchain Doc Loader now.
// challenges 
- can't store pdfs locally because i won't get free storage in free hosting. it will crash my app
- if i store locally, how will I read latest document uploaded by user. also multiple users can lead to crash.

// alternative 
- store in Vercel Blob
- read document using blob 

Solution 1
--> user_1
    - pdfname.pdf
--> user 2
    - pdfname.pdf

?? will i get free storage in Render? - Yes, 16GB
?? how will i create directory with 'user_1' name? - using multur

Pros -> no extra network call, everything locally
Cons -> everything local

Solution 2
--> upload to Vercel Blob
--> read URL and extract pdf Data

?? will langchain loader be able to read Blob URL?
?? do i need to store pdf locally before uploading to Vercel Blob?
