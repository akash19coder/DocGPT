### Why
Imagine you have a long and complex document, like a **research paper or a legal contract**, but you don't have the time or expertise to read through every detail. That's where our app comes in. You simply upload the document, and our app quickly scans through it, picking out the most important information and summarizing it for you in a clear and concise way. So instead of spending hours trying to decipher dense language or technical jargon, you get a brief overview that gives you the key points and helps you understand the main ideas without all the extra fluff. It's like having a personal assistant who sifts through the details and presents you with the highlights, making it easier for you to grasp the main message of any document in no time.

### Motivation
Back in January 2021, I underwent a minor surgery to remove a cyst from my head. While I was in the hospital, I had bunch of medical reports in my hand which I couldn't comprehend because it was using  complex vocabularies and terminologies. So, the nerd inside me was googling everything back and forth. I was wondering how easy it would be if could just upload my document and start having conversation around it and someone would answer all questions.

With the release of OpenAI Large Language models(LLMs), I found a way to implement my idea. Hence, I started building it.
